* Allgin this (monitor) pixel in the crosshair to the right of the center (minecraft) pixel of the eye of ender

### Input
#### Coord+Coord
* Stand on the relatively flat area
* Throw eye of ender and allign crosshair
  - For more accurate measurement, use low FOV(30°) and/or low camera sensitivity(0%)
 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/560213de-383a-49ad-9e6b-70c1d547045e)
* Copy coordinate and press "PASTE" button next to "Coord 1"
* Move forward. Make sure your direction doesn't change due to surrounding terrain 
  - Moving more distance does make prediction accurate, but not being obstructed by terrain is much more important
  - Moving 5 blocks would cause 0.03° standard error and moving more than 16 blocks would ensure standard error smaller than 0.01°
* Copy coordinate and press "PASTE" button next to "Coord 2"
* Press "ADD" button and probabilities will be updated

#### Corner+Facing
* Surround yourself with 4 blocks
* Throw eye of ender and stand at the corner in that direction
* Align crosshair
    - For more accurate measurement, use low FOV(30°) and/or low camera sensitivity(0%)

* Copy coordinate and press "PASTE" button next to "Coord 1"
  - Your both X and Z coordinate should end with either 0.30 or 0.70
* Enable "Full Keyboard Gameplay" and set "Smooth Roatation Speed" to minimum(1)
  - You can find this option in Setting → Controls → Keyboard & Mouse

* Look Down straightly and align your crosshair to edge of the block
* Select whether your crosshair is facing X or Z direction
* Count and write how many (minecraft) pixels the crosshair is from the vertex. Around 2.1 in this example
  - This value should be within 0 and 8
* Press "ADD" button and probabilities will be updated

### Settings
#### Align Error
* Set this value based on how accurate you are in aligning crosshair with eye of ender.
  - Smaller value → Assumes accurate crosshair alignment → More confident prediction
  - Bigger value → Assumes less accurate crosshair alignment → Less confident prediction
* Tip
  - 0.03(Minimum): You can align crosshair (monitor) pixel perfect always
  - 0.3(Default): You can align crosshair (minecraft) pixel perfect
  - 1: You can align crosshair within center third of the ender eye
  - 4(Maximum): You can align crosshair within ender eye

#### Pixel Error
* This setting matters only if your input mode is "Corner+Facing"
* Set this value based on how accurate you can measure how many (minecraft) pixel the crosshair is from the vertex.
  - Smaller value → Assumes accurate measurement → More confident prediction
  - Bigger value → Assumes less accurate measurement → Less confident prediction
* Tip
  - 0.01(Minimum): You can count (monitor) pixels accurately and write the value
  - 0.03: You can count (minecraft) pixels and round to 1 decimal point
  - 0.3(Maximum): You can count (minecraft) pixels and round to nearest integer

#### Input Mode
* Coord+Coord
  - Recommeneded if surrounding terrain is flat
  - Generally more accurate than Corner+Facing
* Corner+Facing
  - Recommended if surrounding terrain is irregular
 
#### Prob Within
* Display probability that stronghold is within N chunks from candidate chunk
* This is supported because in Bedrock Edition, most near stronghold generate under the village. If you can find village in render distance, you can easily locate stronghold with Sprinkz strategy
* It's recommended to set this value according to your render distance

### Troubleshooting
If calculator said 100% probability but stronghold wasn't there, consider..,
* You were obstructed by terrain while measuring direction with "Coord+Coord" input method
* Nearest stronghold was more than 4000 blocks away from (0,0)
* Each eye directed diffrent stronghold
* You set too low value in "align errror" or "pixel error" (=Your measurement were not accurate enough)

## Methodology
### Calculating prior probability
Simulated Bedrock Edition stronghold generation multiple times considering
* Village grid
  - Grid size is 34 chunks in x/z direction
  - Village can generate in chunk 0~27 in each grid
  - Village generate or doesn't generate according to biome, but that's difficult to simulate
  - Assumed there's 26.7% chance of village generating in each grid
* Scattered stronghold grid
  - Grid size is 200 chunks in x/z direction
  - Stronghold can generate in chunk 50~150 in each grid
  - There's 25% chance of stronghold generating in each grid
* Village stronghold generation
  - Simulated village stronghold generation based on Bedrockified by Earthcomputer
  - https://github.com/Earthcomputer/bedrockified/blob/master/src/main/java/net/earthcomputer/bedrockified/BedrockStrongholdStructure.java

Following information was gathered usingsimulation
* How often nearest stronghold is village stronghold or scattered stronghold
  - Nearest stronghold was village stronghold in 80.9% of the cases, scattered stronghold in 19.1% of the cases
* How distance from (0,0) and probability of having a village stronghold correlated
![Figure_1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d293f01-8ec5-4f7f-8da1-7a5675671380)
  - X axis: Distance from (0,0) in chunks, Y axis: Relative probability of chunk having a village stronghold
* How distance from (0,0) and probability of having a scattered stronghold correlated
![Figure_2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2594939e-aee5-4d31-9ce5-a5cd6043370c)
  - X axis: Distance from (0,0) in chunks, Y axis: Relative probability of chunk having a scattered stronghold

Estimated probability of each chunk(distance from (0,0) < 4000) having a stronghold based on simulation data

### Calculating stronghold direction
When you throw eye of ender at (x1,z1), it starts flying from (x1+0.5,z1+0.5)=(a,b) and travels 12 blocks

To determine the stronghold direction, we need to calculate the coordinates where the eye is hovering after it flies

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41311f61-dca2-4cbf-91d9-c78face4cd50)
* A(x1,z1): Coordinate 1, where user threw eye of the ender
* B(x2,z2): Coordinate 2, where user moved and recorded the second position
* C(x1+0.5,z1+0.5)=(a,b): Where eye of ender starts flying
* F(x,z): The point int the air where eye of ender hovers

F(x,z) is one of intersections between line AB and circle(center=C, radius=12)
This can be calculated by solving following system of equations
* z-z1=(z2-z1)/(x2-x1)*(x-x1): Line AB
* (x-a)^2+(z-b)^2=12^2: Circle
Solving this gives us two points, E and F, where the line intersects the circle

By comparing dot product of vector AB, vector CE and dot product of vector AB/vector CF, we can find out which intersection point corresponds to the actual hovering location of the eye

Stronghold is located on the half-line CF

### Calculating standard error
Program assumes 2 types of error affect the prediction
* Measurement error(σ1): How accurately user aligned crosshair
  - This is affected by user defined "Align error"(ε1)
  - Estimated using: σ1=arctan(ε1/12/16) (12: Distance eye flies, 16: Number of pixels in a block)
* Precision error(σ2): How precisely the direction is measured
  - In "Coord+Coord" mode, this is affected by distance between Coordinate 1 and Coordinate 2
  - Estimated using σ2=arctan(0.01*sqrt(2)/distance)*0.2
  - In "Corner+Facing" mode, this is affected by user defined "Pixel error"(ε1)
  - Estimated using σ2=arctan(ε1/16/0.3) (0.3: Distance between the player and block which player is facing)
* Combined error(σ) is calculated σ=sqrt(σ1^2+σ2^2)

### Updating probability
The posterior probability is proportional to the product of prior probability and the likelihood
* Posterior probability: The probability that a certain chunk contains the stronghold afte the new observation
* Prior probability: The probability that a certain chunk contains the stronghold before considering the new observation
* Likelihood: The probability of making the observation if the stronghold were located in that chunk

For normal distribution with mean(μ) and standard deviation(σ), the probability density function(PDF) is

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6dfeba82-db9d-4b86-8060-6d7ee3e7dc6b)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b4bbb81-6e7d-40bf-b3d3-8a491d815e09)

The value of PDF at x=A represents relative likelihood of observing value A from this distribution

If observed angle is θ and the eye of ender started flying from point C(a,b), for each chunk, the likelihood is calculated
* Eye of ender points to (2,2) of stronghold chunk
* Compute the direction vector from the eye's start point to the (2,2) of the chunk, vector CSn=(xn-a,zn-b)
* Calculate the angle(Δθ) between eye's observed direction and expected direction to the chunk
* Likelihood is value of PDF at x=Δθ, given μ=0, σ=combined error

After calculating unnormalized probabilities for all candidate chunks, normalize them so that total probability sums up to 1
